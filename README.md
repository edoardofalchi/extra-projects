# extra-projects in Pyhton | Edoardo Falchi
This repository contains the notebook of several mini-projects I did starting from my own personal interest. Topics range from very different domain.

Here is the list with a brief summary of the content for each mini-project (click on the link to jump straightaway into the rendered notebook):

* **[Decision Trees for heart disease](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/Decision%20Trees%20-%20Heart%20disease.ipynb)** :heartbeat:
> In this notebook I use scikit-learn and Cost Complexity Pruning to build Classification Tree, which uses continuous and categorical data from the UCI ML Repository to predict whether or not a patient has hearth disease based on their sex, age, blood pressure and a variety of other metrics. Specifically, I use the Heart Disease Dataset

* **[Monte Carlo simulation: the runner example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/Monte%20Carlo%20Code.ipynb)** :runner:
> In this notebook I implement MC simulation in order to illustrate and get familiar with this method.

* **[Products rating](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/main?filepath=Product%20rating.ipynb)** :shopping:
> Here I try to answer to a simple question which propably we had to answer few times while doing online shopping for example on Amazon: would you rather buy the product with less reviews but higher rating stars, or a similar product with more reviews but lower rating stars? I analyse this issue by means of a Monte Carlo simulation varying sample size and distribution of ratings

* **[SVM for cancer cells](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/SVM_cancer%20cells.ipynb)** :medical_symbol:
> I use Support Vector Machine to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign (mild state) or malignant (evil state).

* **[Sample Size: energy drink campaign](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/Sample%20Size.ipynb)** :cup_with_straw:
> in the first part I implement a Monte Carlo simulation and in the second part a Bayesian analysis where based on prior understanding about how likely we are to have any of many 'true' distributions.

* **[Fractal](https://github.com/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/Fractals.ipynb)** :art:
> This notebook illustrates how to plot fractals in python. Specifically I plot the Barnsley fern using python, numpy and matplotlib.

* **[International Space Station current location](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/Space%20station.ipynb)** :artificial_satellite:
> This notebook is aimed at locating and plotting the location of the International Space Station.

* **[Pi approximation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/pi%20approximation%20function.ipynb)** :white_circle:
> I want to estimate $ \pi $, given that having random (0,1)

* **[Dif-in-Dif: physician copayment](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/physician%20copayment%20reform%20%28Dif-in-Dif%20design%29.ipynb)** :hospital:
> Did elimination of copayment in Norway increase visits to the physician? This notebook implements the Difference in Difference method for causality.
