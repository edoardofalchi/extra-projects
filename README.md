# extra-projects in Pyhton | Edoardo Falchi
This repository contains the notebook of several mini-projects I did starting from my own personal interest. Topics range from very different domain.

Here is the list with a brief summary of the content for each mini-project (click on the link to jump straightaway into the notebook rendered with Nbviewer):

* **[Decision Trees for heart disease](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/Decision%20Trees%20-%20Heart%20disease.ipynb)** :heartbeat:
> In this notebook I use scikit-learn and Cost Complexity Pruning to build Classification Tree, which uses continuous and categorical data from the UCI ML Repository to predict whether or not a patient has hearth disease based on their sex, age, blood pressure and a variety of other metrics. Specifically, I use the Heart Disease Dataset
