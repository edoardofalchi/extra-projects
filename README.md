# extra-projects in Pyhton | Edoardo Falchi
This repository contains the notebook of several mini-projects I did starting from my own personal interest. Topics range from very different domain.

Here is the list with a brief summary of the content for each mini-project (click on the link to jump straightaway into the rendered notebook):

* **[Decision Trees for heart disease](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/Decision%20Trees%20-%20Heart%20disease.ipynb)** :heartbeat:
> In this notebook I use scikit-learn and Cost Complexity Pruning to build Classification Tree, which uses continuous and categorical data from the UCI ML Repository to predict whether or not a patient has hearth disease based on their sex, age, blood pressure and a variety of other metrics. Specifically, I use the Heart Disease Dataset

* **[Monte Carlo simulation: the runner example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/blob/main/Monte%20Carlo%20Code.ipynb)** :runner:
> In this notebook I implement MC simulation in order to illustrate and get familiar with this method.

* **[Products rating](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/edoardofalchi/extra-projects/main?filepath=Product%20rating.ipynb)** :shopping:
> Here I try to answer to a simple question which propably we had to answer few times while doing online shopping for example on Amazon: would you rather buy the product with less reviews but higher rating stars, or a similar product with more reviews but lower rating stars? I analyse this issue by means of a Monte Carlo simulation varying sample size and distribution of ratings
